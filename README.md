# datafest2021
Team repository for Datafest 2021 @ University of Edinburgh

Note that work displayed here has been heavily edited from what was achieved during the datafest event due to the sensitive nature of the data we were given. While data dictionaries (metadata) are still included to provide context, all data has been deleted and will not be made public at any point for privacy reasons. 
Although none of the actual data has been included, some of the final visualisations produced have been added to the repo as well as the pdf submitted at the end of the event to give an idea of what was produced.
